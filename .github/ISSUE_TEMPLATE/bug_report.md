If a function is not working or a request or response type makes it unavailable, LLM has a problem with the frequency of selection for that function or fails to call a connector, please write a detailed description of the problem.

If you are a user who has had a conversation within our service, I would appreciate it if you could share the content of your speech, the time of your speech, and, if possible, a screenshot of your conversation or a link in the chat.
