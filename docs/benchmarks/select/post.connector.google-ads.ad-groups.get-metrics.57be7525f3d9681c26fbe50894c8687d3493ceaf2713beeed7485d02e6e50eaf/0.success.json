    "description": "Get the performance (metrics) of the ad group.\n\nView metrics per Google customer account ad\n\nPass `customerId` to the user and view statistical metrics for the customer ad group.\nIf `customerId` is not passed, `Wrtn` will automatically select only one ad account that the user can access.\nUsers can view ad metrics for a specific date through this connector,\nand these metrics include impressions, clicks, video views, views based on video playback range, and average page count.\nYou can also check simple information about the searched content, such as the resource name of the ad group.\nIn addition, `costMicros` information is provided, which is the advertising expenditure in micro units and means the amount actually executed.\nIf this figure is `1,000,000`, if the currency unit is `KRW`, 1 won was used.\nThis figure is the actual amount used, unlike the campaign budget, and according to Google policy, advertising costs may be slightly more than the budget. Also, the total spend of the ad group in the campaign must be equal to the total spend of the campaign.\n\nThis connector allows the user to check whether their ads are being executed efficiently in terms of cost and performance.\n\nBefore calling the function, you should ask the user for `customerId`, so you should suggest a connector that can check `customerId`."
