    "description": "Delete file content and commit.\n\nDelete file content in github repository\n\nTo delete file content is the same as creating a single commit.\nCommit is a hash that must be created in github to save changes, such as uploading, modifying, deleting, and so on.\n\nAs the sha value of the file to be modified, a conflict may occur if it is not the latest sha value among the sha values of the file.\nIt's safe when you look up a list of files through API to check sha and put in a value, or want to re-modify the sha value of a file you just created.\n\nIf the user directly asks you to add, modify, or delete a file for a specific PR or specific branch, this connector should be considered.\nMany repositories are working on commit conventions. Before committing, it's a good idea to look up the commit-list to see how you leave the commit message."
