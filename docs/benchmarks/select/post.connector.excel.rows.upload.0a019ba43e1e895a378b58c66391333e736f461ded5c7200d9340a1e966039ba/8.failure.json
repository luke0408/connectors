    "description": "Create Excel and add data by uploading Excel files.\n\nUpload an Excel file to add data to the file\n\nWhen adding data to Excel, sheet creation precedes if it is a sheet that does not exist yet.\nTherefore, this feature can also be used for sheet creation.\nIf you want to create a sheet only and create an empty file without any data,\nyou just need to specify the name of the sheet without any data.\n\nWhen adding rows to an already existing sheet,\nit is supposed to be added to the lower line, so it is recommended to check the data before adding it.\nIf you provide fileUrl, you can modify it after you work on it. After modification, the file will be issued as a new link.\n\nIt is a connector that allows users to upload files by drag and drop."
