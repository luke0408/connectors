    "description": "Modify the campaign.\n\nEdit an ad campaign for your Google customer account\n\nEdit a campaign.\nThe only things you can edit in a campaign are the campaign name, budget, and end date.\nThe campaign name is a value for people to recognize and has no effect on the ad, so you can specify it as you like.\nFor the budget, you can enter the budget you want to advertise in Korean Won (KRW), and in this case, the daily ad spending will be formed above and below the budget.\nIn some cases, you may spend more than the budget, or if the ad optimization is not done, you may spend less than the budget.\nThe last end date can be used as a scheduled end date because the ad will not end and will continue to run if it is not specified.\nHowever, if you do not delete the end date that you have already specified, the ad may not be executed even if you turn it on later.\nIf you want to turn on the ad for a campaign that has ended, you must also change the campaign's scheduled end date.\n\nIf you do not pass `customerId`, it will be automatically selected only if there is only one ad account that `Wrtn` can access from the user.\n\nBefore calling the function, we need to ask the user for `customerId`, so we need to suggest a connector that can check `customerId`.\n\nOriginally, there is no amount limit, but in case of an emergency, we currently limit the function to 100,000 won per campaign."
