    "description": "Add keywords to the ad.\n\nAdd search keywords to ads in Google customer accounts\n\nStrictly speaking, add ad keywords to ad groups (=adGroup).\n\nFor convenience, this connector receives the resource name of the ad, finds the parent ad group of the ad, and then inserts the keyword.\nThe result value of this connector helps users check whether all keywords have been added properly by re-checking them after adding the keyword.\nHowever, not all keywords added are used in ads.\nKeywords are reviewed by Google and used for targeting, and at this time, keywords may be excluded from ad keywords due to inappropriate reviews.\nHowever, since ads will work properly if there are other keywords, it is advantageous to register various keywords so that users can be attracted.\n\nThere are also recommended connectors for keywords.\n\nThis connector receives an ad account as an argument from the user as authentication for the customer account, but this is also optional.\n\nIf `customerId` is not passed, it is automatically selected only if `Wrtn` has only one ad account accessible to the user.\n\nBefore calling the function, we need to ask the user for `customerId`, so we need to suggest a connector that can check `customerId`."
