Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.\nIn any case, you can also view comments with the number on pull request.\nIssue comments are ordered by ascending ID.\n\nThis is actually the same as connector POST '/connector/github/repositories/issues/get-comments'.\nComments and reviews on PR are separate, you can only see comments on this connector."
