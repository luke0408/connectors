    "description": "Get a diff of pull request.\n\nGet a diff of pull-request info\n\nThis is the same as PR's ability to query files,\nbut the format that this function returns is a string, which is more suitable for identifying changes to each file than viewing each file object,\nand in github, this is called the application/vnd.github.diff format.\nThis helps you see at a glance what codes have disappeared and been added in a form suitable for code review.\n\nIf the user wants to see each PR unit, this connector will be suitable.\n\nIf there are too many changes, the connector can export a 406 error.\nIn this case, it may be difficult to determine each change, but it is recommended to use the List pull requests connector."
