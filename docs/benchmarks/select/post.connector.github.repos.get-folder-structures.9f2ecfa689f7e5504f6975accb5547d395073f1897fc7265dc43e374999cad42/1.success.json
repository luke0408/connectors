    "description": "Review Repository Folder Structure\n\nIt allows you to know the overall folder structure by traversing files in the repository.\nThis feature is intended to navigate like a DFS based on folders.\nIf this function is so vast that you cannot see the entire folder, you can pass the `path` again to inquire.\nThe `path` delivered is treated like a Root folder and continues the navigation from this folder.\nThis feature is designed to navigate to the inside two more times, up to steps 0, 1 at a time, based on the root folder.\n\nIf you want to know the details of the file, it is recommended to use the get-contents connector."
