After modification, the file will be issued as a new link.\n\nA connector that allows you to update a file without uploading it if you know the link to the file in the previous utterance, or if you receive a file link in the utterance from the user.\n\nSince a link to the Excel file generated immediately after the Excel file is generated, calling this connector is more advantageous in terms of user experience than adding data through upload."
